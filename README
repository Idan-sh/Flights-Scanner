README:

if you encounter the following error- 
"error while loading shared libraries: libshared_library.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

you will need to run the following command in the terminal in order to tell the program where to look for the shared library during runtime-
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD"

you can also use 'echo' and check that the correct directory (in which the shared library .so file exists) was added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH-
$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
